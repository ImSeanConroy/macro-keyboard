## Features and Development Roadmap

This project is a work in progress, the following outlines the current features and planned improvements:

### Current Features
- Compact Design: Space-saving with minimal desk footprint.
- Customizable Macros: Assign any key functions to match your workflow.
- Layout Variations: Supports various configurations (e.g., 4x1, 2x1, 1x1, 4x2).

### Upcoming Features
- More Variations: Explore additional configurations (3x3 and 2x4).
- Bluetooth Functionality: Add and test wireless connectivity.
- Custom PCB Design: Move away from prebuilt Seeed Studio development boards. (A previous attempt was made, but limited electronics knowledge made debugging and identifying issues difficult.)

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Project** - Open the .kicad_pro file in KiCad to view the project.
2. **Review the Design** - Inspect the schematic and PCB layout to ensure it meets your needs.
3. **Customize or Export** - Make any modifications and export the Gerber files for fabrication.
4. **Order the PCB** - Submit the Gerber files to your preferred PCB manufacturer.
5. **Get the Microcontroller** Purchase the [Seeed XIAO SAMD21](https://thepihut.com/products/seeed-xiao-samd21?srsltid=AfmBOopsKYftJU7zJh318_QIbgNfs8Iwz2q-IXUMCA7OXGZDiutoXrOy) or a compatible board.
6. **3D Print the Case** - Download the STL files for your chosen configuration and print them on a 3D printer.
7. **Assemble the Hardware** - Solder the components and assemble the board and case.
8. **Upload the Firmware** - Connect the board via USB and upload the firmware.
